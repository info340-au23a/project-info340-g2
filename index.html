            Students Navigating Healthcare &#129658;&#128137;&#128138;:

        <h2>Our Problem</h2>
        <p> Every day, students are forced to navigate insurance and healthcare plans on their own. 
            Understanding these complicated jargon-laden forms and applications is an obstacle in itself, 
            and often leads to students feeling helpless. Searching “Washington health insurance” online yields 
            thousands of different web pages with contradicting information which makes it difficult for a young 
            adult to know what the “best” plan for them is. The U.S Census Bureau reports that adults from 19-34
            have the highest uninsured rate of any group in the U.S.. Students who are insured are typically enrolled
             under their parents plans. Healthcare accessibility is a crucial necessity for students, but isn’t 
             effective without healthcare education <a href="https://timelycare.com/blog/access-to-care-and-its-impact-on-college-students/">
            (Booth, Dr.Bob).</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            While many healthcare sites provide resources to educate individuals regarding healthcare plans,
            there hasn’t been a specific attempt to create a centralized platform that provides concise and 
            digestible information targeted towards college students. Through the current resources, students 
            are forced to navigate through multiple websites, portals, and documents scattered across various 
            sources to gather information regarding healthcare options. The effort and time that is poured into 
            scouring these resources can turn students away from engaging into the research and in turn hinder 
            their ability to make well-informed decisions regarding healthcare.
