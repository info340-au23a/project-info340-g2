                    The Husky Problem (Problem Description):
                </h2>
                <p> 
                    Every day, students are forced to track down suitable study locations and are met with limited options, 
                    overcrowded environments, and diverse work preferences. This causes students to feel helpless searching 
                    for a work atmosphere that suits their needs. In a study done by Times Higher Education, it was found 
                    that 72% of the 1,416 surveyed students had been affected by the lack of access to a quiet study space
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/lack-study-space-and-poor-connections-
                    hinder-online-learning#:~:text=It%20found%20that%2072%20per,saying%20they%20were%20severely%20impacted.">
                    (Morgan, John).</a> Choosing a study space comes with risks. Will there be wifi? Is the connection reliable? 
                    Will I be able to find an outlet near my seat? Many students don’t realize that these amenities are 
                    necessities until it’s too late.

                <p> 
                    An information technology problem that we’ve encountered is that there isn’t one 
                    centralized platform that you can use to find all this information in one place, and often, 
                    the information we’re looking for is best found by asking our peers. While sites such as Yelp 
                    provide general ratings and reviews for businesses, there is definitely a lack of information 
                    and features that target the student demographic. Students know best what students need. We 
                    are also looking to create a platform that is UW specific and includes insights from other 
                    students about aspects such as a safety rating on the paths to and from the study space, access 
                    to power outlets, availability and reliability of wifi, noise and crowd level, table space, and more.

                    App Description:
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The users of this application are UW students who are most in need of good and reliable study spaces. To address minority groups, we could include features that inform students on diverse features such as bilingual staff, ADA compliance, lighting brightness, and whether or not the space caters to dietary restrictions and preferences.

                <h2>
                    The Husky Solution (Proposed Application):
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The interactive features that we are expecting to provide are: (1) search and filter for a study space that meets exact needs, (2) review, rate, and comment on a study space, and (3) allow users to create a “PAW-sibilities” list by selecting spaces they want to try. Our first feature would both allow students to choose their most important features and provide suggestions based on their needs as well as allowing students to search for a specific place to see reviews and ratings by other students. The next feature would allow our users to contribute to our forum by providing their own feedback on the places they have been and rating the various amenities of each space on a scale of 0-5 paws. The last feature would allow students to create a bucket list of places they want to visit. The users would be able to select a various number of spaces from our overall list, and add it to a personal list of PAW-sibilities that they can then save and print out for future reference. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    The information that the users will view on our site are: posts for each study space that include their hours, location and list rankings (submitted by students) on amenities such as wifi, outlets, bathroom cleanliness, food quality, area safety, table space, noise level, priciness, busyness, seating space available, and more. Using this app would solve our proposed problem because it would allow students to effectively find a space that fits their diverse needs.
