                    Every day, students are forced to track down suitable study locations and are met with limited options, 
                    overcrowded environments, and diverse work preferences. This causes students to feel helpless searching 
                    for a work atmosphere that suits their needs. In a study done by Times Higher Education, it was found 
                    that 72% of the 1,416 surveyed students had been affected by the lack of access to a quiet study space 
                    <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/lack-study-space-and-poor-connections-hinder-online-learning#:~:

                    space comes with risks. Will there be wifi? Is the connection reliable? Will I be able to find an outlet near my seat? 
                    Many students don’t realize that these amenities are necessities until it’s too late.

                    An information technology problem that we’ve encountered is that there isn’t one 
                    centralized platform that you can use to find all this information in one place, and often, 
                    the information we’re looking for is best found by asking our peers. While sites such as Yelp 
                    provide general ratings and reviews for businesses, there is definitely a lack of information 
                    and features that target the student demographic. Students know best what students need. We 
                    are also looking to create a platform that is UW specific and includes insights from other 
                    students about aspects such as a safety rating on the paths to and from the study space, access 
                    to power outlets, availability and reliability of wifi, noise and crowd level, table space, and more.
