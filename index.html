            Our Problem:
        </h1>
        <p> Every day, students are forced to navigate insurance and healthcare plans on their own. 
            Understanding these complicated jargon-laden forms and applications is an obstacle in itself, 
            and often leads to students feeling helpless. Searching “Washington health insurance” online yields 
            thousands of different web pages with contradicting information which makes it difficult for a young 
            adult to know what the “best” plan for them is. The U.S Census Bureau reports that adults from 19-34
            have the highest uninsured rate of any group in the U.S..Students who are insured are typically enrolled
             under their parents plans. Healthcare accessibility is a crucial necessity for students, but isn’t 
             effective without healthcare education (Booth, Dr.Bob).
