                The Husky Problem (Problem Description):
            </h2>
            <p> An information technology problem that we’ve encountered is that there isn’t one 
                centralized platform that you can use to find all this information in one place, and often, 
                the information we’re looking for is best found by asking our peers. While sites such as Yelp 
                provide general ratings and reviews for businesses, there is definitely a lack of information 
                and features that target the student demographic. Students know best what students need. We 
                are also looking to create a platform that is UW specific and includes insights from other 
                students about aspects such as a safety rating on the paths to and from the study space, access 
                to power outlets, availability and reliability of wifi, noise and crowd level, table space, and more.
